🧠 Project Brief: Interactive Media Literacy Notebook (with GNews Integration)
🎯 Goal
Build a React (Vite + Tailwind CSS) static site that teaches critical thinking through real news headlines, using a friendly, informal learning experience. The course is divided into 5 bite-sized, interactive modules.

⚙️ Stack & Structure
Framework: React + Vite
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Routing: React Router
Responsive: Mobile-first, tablet-friendly, desktop-optimized
Hosting: GitHub Pages or Netlify
Backend: None (static site only)

📰 News Headline Integration: GNews API + GitHub Actions
Purpose: Automatically fetch and update real-world news headlines daily from GNews API.

How it Works:

Data Source: GNews API (filter by relevance, country, language, and date)

Storage: Fetched headlines stored as a local JSON file (headlines.json) in public/data/

Automation: GitHub Action runs on a schedule (e.g. daily at 6AM UTC)

Transform: Data is preprocessed into the format required by card components

Security: API key stored as GitHub Secret (GNEWS_API_KEY)

Error handling: Skip update if GNews API fails; retain last working version

Headline Format: Refer to the api documentation in /attached_assets/GNews-api.txt
