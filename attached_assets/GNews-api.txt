GNews API uses a system of API keys to authenticate you. If you don't have an API key yet, you have to sign up first. Once you have created an account you will find your API key in the dashboard.

Your API key must be passed in the query string of your HTTP request like this:

https://gnews.io/api/v4/{endpoint}?apikey=API_KEY

 You must replace API_KEY with your API key that you find in your dashboard.
Search Endpoint
To use the search endpoint, use this code:

apikey = '9b6c3eade3969feb0d529f3335c959de';
url = 'https://gnews.io/api/v4/search?q=example&lang=en&country=us&max=10&apikey=' + apikey;

fetch(url)
  .then(function (response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function (data) {
    articles = data.articles;

    for (i = 0; i < articles.length; i++) {
      // articles[i].title
      console.log("Title: " + articles[i]['title']);
      // articles[i].description
      console.log("Description: " + articles[i]['description']);
      // You can replace {property} below with any of the article properties returned by the API.
      // articles[i].{property}
      // console.log(articles[i]['{property}']);

      // Delete this line to display all the articles returned by the request. Currently only the first article is displayed.
      break;
    }
  });
Make sure to replace API_KEY with your API key that you can find in your dashboard.

This endpoint allows you to search for news articles through a combination of keywords.

HTTP Request
GET https://gnews.io/api/v4/search?q=example&apikey=9b6c3eade3969feb0d529f3335c959de

Query Parameters
Parameter Name	Default Value	Description
q	None	This parameter is mandatory.
This parameter allows you to specify your search keywords to find the news articles you are looking for. The keywords will be used to return the most relevant articles. It is possible to use logical operators with keywords, see the section on query syntax.
lang	Any	This parameter allows you to specify the language of the news articles returned by the API. You have to set as value the 2 letters code of the language you want to filter.
See the list of supported languages
country	Any	This parameter allows you to specify the country where the news articles returned by the API were published, the contents of the articles are not necessarily related to the specified country. You have to set as value the 2 letters code of the country you want to filter.
See the list of supported countries
max	10	This parameter allows you to specify the number of news articles returned by the API. The minimum value of this parameter is 1 and the maximum value is 100. The value you can set depends on your subscription.
See the pricing for more information
in	title,description	This parameter allows you to choose in which attributes the keywords are searched. The attributes that can be set are title, description and content. It is possible to combine several attributes by separating them with a comma.
e.g. title,description
nullable	None	This parameter allows you to specify the attributes that you allow to return null values. The attributes that can be set are description, content and image. It is possible to combine several attributes by separating them with a comma.
e.g. description,content
from	None	This parameter allows you to filter the articles that have a publication date greater than or equal to the specified value. The date must respect the following format:
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD
TZD = time zone designator, its value must always be Z (universal time)
e.g. 2025-06-06T10:03:38Z
to	None	This parameter allows you to filter the articles that have a publication date smaller than or equal to the specified value. The date must respect the following format:
YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD
TZD = time zone designator, its value must always be Z (universal time)
e.g. 2025-06-06T10:03:38Z
sortby	publishedAt	This parameter allows you to choose with which type of sorting the articles should be returned. Two values are possible:
publishedAt = sort by publication date, the articles with the most recent publication date are returned first
relevance = sort by best match to keywords, the articles with the best match are returned first
page	1	This parameter will only work if you have a paid subscription activated on your account.
This parameter allows you to control the pagination of the results returned by the API. The paging behavior is closely related to the value of the max parameter. The first page is page 1, then you have to increment by 1 to go to the next page. Let's say that the value of the max parameter is 10, then the first page will contain the first 10 articles returned by the API (articles 1 to 10), page 2 will return the next 10 articles (articles 11 to 20), the behavior extends to page 3, 4, ...
expand	None	This parameter will only work if you have a paid subscription activated on your account.
This parameter allows you to return in addition to other data, the full content of the articles. To get the full content of the articles, the parameter must be set to content
Query Syntax
Things to know before you start :

In this section, the word query refers to the value of the q parameter and not to the HTTP request.
The query must be URL-encoded.
It is not possible to use special characters without putting quotes around them.
e.g.

Non Valid	Valid
Hello!	"Hello!"
Left - Right	"Left - Right"
Question?	"Question?"
Phrase Search Operator
This operator allows you to make an exact search. Keywords surrounded by quotation marks are used to search for articles with the exact same keyword sequence. For example the query: "Apple iPhone" will return articles matching at least once this sequence of keywords.

Logical AND Operator
This operator allows you to make sure that several keywords are all used in the article search. By default the space character acts as an AND operator, it is possible to replace the space character by AND to obtain the same result. For example the query: Apple Microsoft is equivalent to Apple AND Microsoft

Logical OR Operator
This operator allows you to retrieve articles matching the keyword a or the keyword b. It is important to note that this operator has a higher precedence than the AND operator. For example the query: Apple OR Microsoft will return all articles matching the keyword Apple as well as all articles matching the keyword Microsoft

Due to the higher precedence of the operator OR the following query will not work as expected: Apple AND iPhone OR Microsoft. Normally, articles matching the keywords Apple and iPhone are returned first and then articles matching the keyword Microsoft are returned. Because of the precedence of the OR operator, in practice the query will return articles matching Apple AND iPhone or Apple AND Microsoft. To have a normal behavior, it is necessary to add brackets. The query Apple AND iPhone OR Microsoft will behave normally when it is in this form: (Apple AND iPhone) OR Microsoft

Logical NOT Operator
This operator allows you to remove from the results the articles corresponding to the specified keywords. To use it, you need to add NOT in front of each word or phrase surrounded by quotes. For example the query: Apple NOT iPhone will return all articles matching the keyword Apple but not the keyword iPhone

Examples of valid queries
Query
Microsoft Windows 10
Apple OR Microsoft
Apple AND NOT iPhone
(Windows 7) AND (Windows 10)
"Apple iPhone 13" AND NOT "Apple iPhone 14"
Intel AND (i7 OR i9)
(Intel AND (i7 OR "i9-13900K")) AND NOT AMD AND NOT "i7-13700K"
Top Headlines Endpoint
To use the top headlines endpoint, use this code:

apikey = '9b6c3eade3969feb0d529f3335c959de';
category = 'general';
url = 'https://gnews.io/api/v4/top-headlines?category=' + category + '&lang=en&country=us&max=10&apikey=' + apikey;

fetch(url)
  .then(function (response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function (data) {
    articles = data.articles;

    for (i = 0; i < articles.length; i++) {
      // articles[i].title
      console.log("Title: " + articles[i]['title']);
      // articles[i].description
      console.log("Description: " + articles[i]['description']);
      // You can replace {property} below with any of the article properties returned by the API.
      // articles[i].{property}
      // console.log(articles[i]['{property}']);

      // Delete this line to display all the articles returned by the request. Currently only the first article is displayed.
      break;
    }
  });
Make sure to replace API_KEY with your API key that you can find in your dashboard.
